<h2>Object Class:</h2>
<blockquote>Safe</blockquote>
<h2>Special Containment Procedures:</h2>
<blockquote>
SCP-617-CN must be placed in a 12X12 ft bedroom, the bedroom must have a king sized bed, with soft pillows and quilt on the bed. The quantity of pillows are limited to four, putting more than four pillows on the bed would cause the mood SCP-617-CN become worse. A specially designed bathtub is required in the bedroom, the bathtub should always be filled with mint-flavored warm water, the temperature of the water should not be higher than 60 degree Celsius. Overheated water would cause high temperature vapor splash from SCP-617-CN’s body. Daily supplies should be served to SCP-617-CN, with the preferences of East Asian food. D Class people who serve daily supplies should not interact with SCP-617-CN, no matter what kind of interaction. D Class people should be noticed that SCP-617-CN is not a dog, it’s not a pet.

<h2>Description:</h2>
<blockquote>
SCP-617-CN is a 170cm high human-like hybrid that both have wolf ears and snake tail. It appears to be a 16 years old male teenager, with Asian race. The left eye of SCP-617-CN is wolf eye, the right eye of SCP-617-CN is snake eye. SCP-617-CN have some kind of intelligence, similar to the average intelligence of a human teenager. By analyzing the fur from SCP-617-CN’s ears, the result shows the wolf ears of SCP-617-CN are from Newfoundland wolf, a wolf that already extinct a few centuries ago. The research sample shows, the tail of SCP-617-CN have 99.99% of gene similarity with titanoboa, which was also an extinct animal. The A-level researchers stated in their research result that the age of SCP-617-CN couldn’t match the age of SCP-617-CN’s appearance; the actual age of SCP-617-CN could not be calculated, the prediction range would be 60 to 100 billion years old. As the researchers highlighted, due to the abnormal DNA structure of SCP-617-CN, it’s unreasonable for SCP-617-CN to live for billions of years long. Researchers are still trying to figure out what prevent SCP-617-CN’s mechanical system from being corrupted.
